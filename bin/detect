#
# A [buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) is an
# adapter between a Python application and Heroku's runtime.

# ## Usage
# Compiling an app into a slug is simple:
#
#     $ bin/detect <build-dir> <cache-dir>

BUILD_DIR=$1

# `Python/Django` if `**/settings.py` is present.
#
# Otherwise, `Python`.
